#This repository contains my work for CS 102 for the Full Stack Nanodegree at Udacity.com.

My final project is contained in the MovieTrailer-Project folder. This folder includes my class files, instances of the class, and the provided fresh_tomatoes.py, which built fresh_tomatoes.html dynamically.

To run the program, run movie_project.py file and it will build fresh_tomatoes.html. Or just open fresh_tomatoes.html and view what I have built previously.
